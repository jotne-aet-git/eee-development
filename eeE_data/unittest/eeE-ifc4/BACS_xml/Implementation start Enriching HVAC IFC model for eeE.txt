Hi everyone  
 
I talked to each one of you explaining the concept of enhancing the HVAC model and asked for your 
feedback. The results are reflected in the documents you will find attached.  
 
Amongst the documents you will find an actual IFC representation of the concept for the manifold 
example providing the opportunity to Jens and me to work on our problem field independently from the 
implementation progress.  
Another new document is a small explanation how the data and metadata in the XML file are translated 
into the IFC model. Feel free to comment on both.  
 
If you find any errors being it typos, the IFC example or on the concept itself, please inform the whole 
group. In future we should use a common place to share the docs. Arne offered to use his github server 
instead of the eeE sharepoint (jungle).  
If everyone is ok I ask you Arne to setup something for us :)  
 
Current Roadmap:  
 
a. Florian will create a XML file based on one of the underfloor heating models for Brussels until 22. Feb 
and share it with Arne.  
b. Based on the concept and the XML file Arne will start to implement the feature when his schedule 
allows it.  
    => Open question: In Vienna we talked to upload the XML file on the BIM server via an API. I guess 
this is still valid and the feature will be accessible with an API call?  
c. During March/April me and Jens will use the enhanced HVAC model to verify for completeness on the 
actual Brussels model.  
 
 
I want to take the opportunity to say thanks to each one of you for your effort on this subject.  
 
 
Best Regards  
Milos
