This document is a (hopefully) short explanation of each tag and attribute in the xml file and
how they are represented in the IFC schema/model.

# <systems>

Root node of the XML file. No representation in IFC.

  - No attributes.


# <system>

The actual system.

  - type (mandatory)
    This attributes defines the function of the system. It has to be one of the values from 
    IfcDistributionSystemEnum.

  - reference (mandatory)
    The name of the system. Should follow a predefined naming convention. Current proposal is 
    PlantX, AreaX, SegmentX where X is an autoincremented number for each of those three distinctions.
    The value is mapped to the property "Reference" of the property set "Pset_DistributionSystemCommon".

    => Alternative would be to use the Name attribute of IfcDistributionSystem, but semantically the
       property Reference looks correct.

  - designHeatLoad (optional)
    The design heatload value for the entire system (if applicable). Represented with the property 
    "DesignHeatLoad" within a custom property set "DDS_Simulation".

  - designOutsideAirTemperature (optional)
    The outside temperature the system should be able to cope with. Represented with the property 
    "DesignOutsideAirTemperature" within a custom property set "DDS_Simulation".

  - partOfSystem (optional)
    Helper attribute to build the relationship between systems in the IFC model. Output is an IFC
    entity of type IfcRelAggregates relating the two systems.

  - guid (optional)
    The GlobalId of an IFC entity. Can be reused if provided.

  - ifcEntity (mandatory)
    Helper attribute to regenerate the correct IFC entity if for some reasons the original instance
    was deleted.


# <components>

Grouping of several components providing a share of the service. Represented as IfcRelAssignsToGroup 
in IFC.

  - designHeatLoadPercentage (optional)
    Value expressed in percentage to reflect the share this group provides to the system.

    !!!Caution: Not yet defined how to represent this in IFC as IfcRelAssigns and the subtypes 
		can not have assigned (custom) property sets. Maybe one of the inherited attributes 
		e.g. Name or Description can be (mis-) used


# <component>

HVAC component which is tied to the (sub-) system (fulfilling a distinct functionality).

  - name (mandatory)
    Human readable name of the component. Should be unique to the project as it will serve as
    the identification, not the GlobalId. Can follow a naming convention but not required.

  - designHeatLoad (optional)
    The design heatload value for the component (if applicable). Represented with the property 
    "DesignHeatLoad" within a custom property set "DDS_Simulation".

  - guid (optional)
    The GlobalId of an IFC entity. Can be reused if provided.

  - ifcEntity (mandatory)
    Helper attribute to regenerate the correct IFC entity if for some reasons the original instance
    was deleted.


# <ports>

Grouping of all ports related to the component. No explicit translation in IFC.

  - No attributes.


# <port>

The actual port.

  - name (mandatory)
    Human readable name of the component. Should be unique to the project as it will serve as
    the identification, not the GlobalId. Can follow a naming convention but not required.

  - connectedToPort (mandatory)
    Helper attribute to create the connection between different ports. Ports which are not yet 
    connected to another port (e.g. mechanical valve port which will be connected with an actuator 
    port) have this field empty (or null).

  - systemReference
    Helper attribute to create a relation between the port and a distribution system where the port 
    belongs logically to the system. Represented in IFC with the entity IfcRelAssignsToProduct.

  - guid (optional)
    The GlobalId of an IFC entity. Can be reused if provided.

  - ifcEntity (mandatory)
    Helper attribute to regenerate the correct IFC entity if for some reasons the original instance
    was deleted.
