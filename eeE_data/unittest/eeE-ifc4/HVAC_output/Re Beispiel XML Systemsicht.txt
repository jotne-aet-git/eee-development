Hi All,

please find attached the xml examples for the interface b/n bacs and hvac, done with the early 
design test cases as well the ifc’s where the cases are based on and the schema descriptions from 
Miloš.

Don’t hesitate to go in touch in case if there any questions.

Otherwise I wish you a relaxing Friday and a nice weekend.

Looking forward to Munic!

Florian
