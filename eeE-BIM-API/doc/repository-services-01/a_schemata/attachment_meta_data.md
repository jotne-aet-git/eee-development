## Attachment Meta Data

**An *attachment* can be attached to:**

* A model with specific version - meaning the attachment will not be brought forward if a new model version is created
* A model without specific version - meaning the attachment will still be attached to the newest model when a new version is created
* A "repository" which means the attachment is a document / model / file in its own right.
 
For each attachment the following attributes are used for  meta data, as members of a meta data element:
 
 Attribute   | Type | Comment |
-------------|------|---------|
project_name |String|Names the project the owning model belongs to
model_guid	 |String|Unique identifier of the model if attachment is attached to a model with version.
model_name	 |String|Name of the model of attachment is attached to a model across versions
attachment_guid	 |String|Unique identifier of the attachment (file). The guid is generated on the server, and differs between versions
attachment_name	 |String|Name of the attachment. Also used as "attachment id". Then name is same across versions
attachment_type	 |String|Type of the attachment (e.g. IFC2x3, XLS, docx, â€¦.) 
attachment_version|String|Version of the model, usually server generated in sthe form of V21,V2,V3,...
schema_url	 |String|URL to the model schema
